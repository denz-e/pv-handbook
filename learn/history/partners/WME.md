By tapping into the networks and partnerships of WME, PV will be able to push their IP across many different verticals (film, TV, podcasting, gaming) to capture mainstream attention.

> _**GFunk:** With WME, you’re not really just dealing with one agent, you’re dealing with subject matter expertise across a variety of verticals. We have someone who’s in legacy publishing - whether that be comics, books etc. We have someone whose sole responsibility is television, we have film, we have digital media, we have a gaming agent. You have all of these people whose sole incentive is to develop business for you as that’s the only way they make money. They don’t collect a cheque from us otherwise._ [_(source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-KRUjfQj3g)
