# Blur Studio

In May 2022, Pixel Vault announced that [Blur Studio](http://blur.com/) (who has worked on films like [Deadpool](http://blur.com/feed/#20160224-blurs-vfx-work-on-deadpool) and created the Netflix series [Love, Death & Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,\_Death\_%26\_Robots)) will be working to re-envision the MetaHero Universe, and create both short & long form content.

> _**GFunk:** We are thrilled to have partnered with Blur Studio, a team that inspires us, to re-envision the MetaHero Universe. For those of you unfamiliar with their work, I would suggest watching their_ [_company reel_](http://www.blur.com/projects/new-reel-2020) _or “Love, Death, & Robots” on Netflix. With their help, we are ready to raise the bar for what content coming from web3 can look/feel/sound like._
>
> _We are underway with character redesign and hard at work on the design of the \*highly complex\* “Sidekicks” project. Given the co-dependency of the short-form content we are making alongside Blur, we are taking great care to make sure that the NFTs and animated series are telling a consistent story. In addition to the consistency of design assets, we are working on world-building and the development of scripts to ultimately tell the stories of the MetaHero Universe in a manner inspired by Love, Death, & Robots — shorter form and open to many different artistic interpretations._
>
> _For those familiar with premium content development cycles, we expect the longer form content to take quite some time — about a year based on our more aggressive goals — but we will be releasing teasers, concept art, and keeping the community engaged along the way. Both Blur and Pixel Vault believe in letting the work speak for itself — if something is of the highest caliber, there is no need for empty hype. We want the work to do the talking._ [_(source: 10 Questions for GFunk)_](https://medium.com/@pixelvault/10-questions-for-gfunk-d2a779a5971c)__
