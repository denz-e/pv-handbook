# adidas

On 29 November 2021, Pixel Vault [announced](https://hypebeast.com/2021/11/adidas-metaverse-four-way-collaboration-info) another major partnership - this time with [adidas](https://www.adidas.com.au/metaverse), and alongside [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and crypto investor [gmoney](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT). Keep in mind - at this point, Pixel Vault was just over 6 months old.

The partnership saw adidas [featured](https://twitter.com/punkscomic/status/1471539647188770821) in [PUNKS Comic Issue #2](../../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#2), and led to the launch of adidas’ first NFT collection, called [Into The Metaverse](https://www.adidas.com/into\_the\_metaverse). This wasn’t just a one-time collaboration either - to this day, PV continues to work closely with adidas on their NFT project.
