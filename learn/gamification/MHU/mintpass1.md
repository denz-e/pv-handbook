# MintPass #1: Burn or Hold

[MintPass #1](../../ecosystem/MHU/mintpass/1.md) is the ticket to getting an Inhabitants Identity. Pixel Vault has given holders 2 choices:

* **burn** the MintPass and receive a [Generative](../../ecosystem/MHU/identities.md#generative-metahero-identities); or
* **hold** onto it for the chance of winning one of 144 [Cores](../../ecosystem/MHU/identities.md#core-metahero-identities), which are raffled out in groups of 12

## Burn vs. Hold

At first glance, it seems obvious that you should test your luck for a Core. However, PV doesn’t make it that easy. There have been a lot of benefits to holding a Generative:

* 1 free [Planet DAO token](../../ecosystem/MHU/planets.md); dependent on the planetary origin of the Generative, which is randomly assigned at mint
* 2 free [MintPass #2](../../ecosystem/MHU/mintpass/2.md) (1 for holding the Identity, and 1 for holding the free Planet)
* the option to stake for [$POW](../../ecosystem/MHU/POW.md), the in-game currency of the Inhabitants ecosystem. 20% of the 1 billion $POW tokens was set aside for those staking their Inhabitants Identities
* eligibility to mint [Gear Pods](../../ecosystem/MHU/gear-pods.md) and participate in raffles as part of [POWer Up Summer](../../../whats-on/POWerUpSummer.md)&#x20;
* it's part of the [Genesis Set](../sets.md)

Just as with PUNKS Comic #1, PV forces collectors to make decisions based on their preferences and risk appetite, e.g.

* _do you burn your MintPass to see if you’ll get a rare Generative, and the chance to claim a rarer planet?_
* _do you want the guaranteed benefits of having a Generative, or do you give those up for the chance at winning a Core?_
* _do you want to participate in POWer Up Summer to build your supply of Gear Pods and get the chance to win the MintPass #2 raffles?_
* _do you want to have a Genesis Set, and the potential perks that may come from it, or do you prefer the guaranteed rewards from having a Generative?_
* _and the game theory element - if more people are burning their MintPass #1, the odds of winning a Core increase, so do you continue to hold?_

## Outcome

There is no expiry date for when MintPass #1 can be burned for a Generative, so this game has been ongoing since since August 2021. It’s hard to know if/when it’ll end given the chance of winning a Core, and the potential rewards for holding a Genesis Set.

The final Core raffle was completed on 21 Oct 2022.
