# PUNKS Comic #2: Elite Ape Collector's Editions

[PUNKS Comic #2](../../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#2) is a special part of Pixel Vault’s history as it marked the company’s partnership with [adidas](../../history/partners/adidas.md) and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Within the comic, 8 Bored Ape characters, collectively known as the **Elite Apes**, were brought to life, and also onto the covers of [limited edition comics](https://punkscomic.com/elite-apes.html) (750 supply of each). The backstory of the Elite Apes’ partnership with Pixel Vault, makes PUNKS Comic #2 even more special.

## Elite Apes

In June 2021, shortly after releasing PUNKS Comic #1, Pixel Vault held a bracket style competition called **Ape Madness:**

* the Bored Ape Yacht Club community to submitted names and backstories of their Apes
* Pixel Vault narrowed down the submissions to 64
* PUNKS Comic #1 holders voted on their favourites over 3 rounds, ultimately leaving 8 winners - the **Elite Apes**

## Elite Ape Entry Coins

For the release of the Elite Ape Collector's Editions, Pixel Vault created a new drop mechanic - [an on-chain queue system](https://medium.com/@punkscomic/how-pixel-vault-built-a-provably-fair-on-chain-queue-for-the-elite-apes-collectors-edition-drop-efc02bb2904c). It created a fair opportunity for all those within the Pixel Vault and Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystems to participate without any gas wars, despite the limited supply.

In short:

* Pixel Vault allowed holders of Pixel Vault and/or Bored Ape Yacht Club assets to claim up to 3 [Elite Ape Entry Coins](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd0b53410454370a482979c0adaf3667c6308a801/0)
* The minting of the comics was designed to take place in stages. Each coin held represented an entry into a raffle, which determined the stage in which an Entry Coin holder would be able to mint
* During the minting process, collectors could choose whichever comic they wanted, on a first-come-first-serve basis. To mint, they needed to burn their Entry Coin

Collectors had many decisions to make, e.g.

* _did they want to increase their odds of minting by purchasing additional Entry Coins on secondary markets?_
* _or did they prefer to sell the Entry Coins and give up their chances of qualifying for the mint?_
* _given the opportunity to mint, which cover should they choose?_

## Outcome

* The original 19,328 supply of Entry Coins has been reduced to 13,328
* 6,000 Entry Coins were burned to mint the 6,000 Elite Ape Collector's Editions
