# PUNKS Comic #3: Pack Style Drop

[PUNKS Comic #3: A Glitch in Time](../../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#3) **** is special part of the Pixel Vault's history for many reasons:

* from a storytelling perspective, it's the first time [Inhabitants Identities](../../ecosystem/IU/identities.md) appear in [PUNKS Comic](../../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/)
* it's the last paid mint for the PUNKS Comic series, making it the final piece of the [Genesis PUNKS Comic Set (PUNKS Comic #1-#3).](../sets.md) Holders of this set are entitled to a free PUNKS PFP, which will become the access pass to PUNKS content & utility moving forward
* and most significantly, it was a gamified **pack style drop,** which led to the redistribution of over 1600 Pixel Vault assets from PV, back to their community

![There are 3 editions of PUNKS Comic #3](<../../../.gitbook/assets/PUNKS Comic 3 - Covers>)

## Pack Style Drop

Typically, when you're minting an NFT, you have a general idea of what asset you'll receive, even though there can be an element of randomness in terms of the output. For example, when you burn your [MintPass #1](../../ecosystem/IU/mintpass/1.md) for a [Generative Inhabitants Identity](../../ecosystem/IU/identities.md#generative-metahero-identities), you know you'll receive a Generative but it's traits are randomised. However, Pixel Vault gamified the experience of minting PUNKS Comic #3 by allowing minters a chance of receiving another Pixel Vault asset instead of a PUNKS Comic #3 standard edition.

**Here's how it worked:**

* The mint was designed to take place over 4 mint windows. A snapshot of Pixel Vault asset holders was taken to determine who could mint in each window, and how many they could mint. For example, priority was given to genesis token holders, followed by planet holders.
* In total, there were 18,000 NFTs to be minted. During the minting process, collectors could pay 0.2 ETH to mint for a randomised chance of receiving one of the following assets:
  * **3 variations of PUNKS Comic #3**
    * standard (14,693 distributed, and 307 held back by Pixel Vault)
    * collector's editions with an alternate cover (1,500)
    * holographic cover signed by GFunk & Chris Wahl (150)
  * **genesis tokens from the Pixel Vault treasury which they acquired as part of their** [**separation from Beanie**](../../history/beanie.md)****
    * [PUNKS Comic #1](../../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#1) (130)
    * [Pixel Vault Founder's DAO](../../ecosystem/pvfd.md) (665)
    * [MintPass #1](../../ecosystem/IU/mintpass/1.md) (350)
    * [Generative Inhabitants Identities](../../ecosystem/IU/identities.md#generative-metahero-identities) (500)
    * [Pixel Vault Core Identities](../../ecosystem/IU/identities.md#core-metahero-identities) (12)&#x20;

## Outcome

In total, 1,657 genesis tokens from the Pixel Vault treasury were distributed back to the Pixel Vault community via the mint.
