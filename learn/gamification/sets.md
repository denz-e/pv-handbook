# Collector Sets

Pixel Vault has announced a number of official sets:

* **Genesis Set:** 1 x [PUNKS Comic #1](../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#1), 1 x [Pixel Vault Founder's DAO](../ecosystem/pvfd.md), 1 x [Inhabitants Identity](../ecosystem/MHU/identities.md), 1 x [MintPass #1](../ecosystem/MHU/mintpass/1.md)
* **Planet Set:** 1 of each of the [Planet DAO tokens](../ecosystem/MHU/planets.md)
* **Genesis PUNKS Comic Set:** 1 x [PUNKS Comic #1](../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#1), 1 x [PUNKS Comic #2](../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#2), 1 x [PUNKS Comic #3](../ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#3)
* **Origin Stories Set 1:** 1 of each of Origin Stories Issues 1-8

This creates a more fun and engaging collector experience, and allows set holders to signal to Pixel Vault that they're early or passionate supporters. Because of that, PV tends to reward set holders.&#x20;

**For example:**

* Bonus [MintPass #2s](../ecosystem/MHU/mintpass/2.md) were given to Genesis Set and Planet Set holders
* For each Planet Set held, collectors be given 1 [Nebula Gear Pod](../../whats-on/POWerUpSummer.md#2-nebula-gear-pod-distribution-and-raffles)
