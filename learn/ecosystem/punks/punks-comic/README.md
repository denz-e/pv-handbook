# PUNKS Comic

****[**PUNKS Comics**](https://punkscomic.com/the-comics.html) are \~20-30 page comics which tell the story of the [PUNKS](16-punks.md); the characters who are based on the 16 CryptoPunks originally owned by Pixel Vault.

The comics in this series are initially released digitally as NFTs, but holders can also claim a physical edition.

**Note for Collectors:**

It’s best to think of the comics as collectibles, and a medium for PV to tell stories and craft their universe. Sometimes, there are perks and game mechanics attached to the various comics. However, bear in mind that it’s unrealistic to expect every comic to come with utility and fun, beyond your enjoyment of the art and story.
