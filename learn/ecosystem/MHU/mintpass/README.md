# MintPass

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is a MintPass?**

MintPasses are essentially a reservation system for NFTs. You can think of it as unopened trading card packs - you know there’s a trading card (or in our case, an NFT) inside, but you don’t know what it is until you open it.

Prior to MintPasses, new launches of NFT projects were first-come, first-serve. This was problematic at the time because:

* to make transactions on a blockchain like Ethereum, users pay transaction fees (i.e. gas fees)
* while there’s a limit to the number of transactions which can be processed in each block, users can choose to pay extra for their transaction to be prioritised
* first-come, first-serve NFT launches created a dynamic where users would choose to pay high amounts of fees in a rush to mint their NFT before the supply ran out, also known as a _gas war_

Gas wars favour those with the most capital, so Pixel Vault [conceptualised](https://twitter.com/pixelvault\_/status/1412479227484573701?s=20\&t=itBHmINnIMJBeVSRdHts1Q) the MintPass in July 2021 to enable more fair & equitable NFT drops. The concept was quick to be adopted by other teams and is now extremely common.
