# MintPass #2

[**MintPass #2**](https://punkscomic.com/mintpass2.html) **** will be used to receive one of the [DOTs](../DOTs.md):&#x20;

* each MintPass #2 can be exchanged for the lowest-tier DOT (Tier 1)
* they can also be used to upgrade the tier of existing DOTs. There are no details of the upgrade mechanics yet, but it will be _“exponentially deflationary”_

It was distributed for free, for each Planet or Inhabitants Identity held by collectors, with certain bonuses which entitled collectors to additional MintPasses.
