# Gear Pods

****[**Gear Pods**](https://metaherouniverse.com/gearpods.html) are "critical supplies" that the [DOTs](DOTs.md) are deploying to [Inhabitants Identities](identities.md) to help them power up and explore the[ Inhabitants Universe](./).

**How Gear Pods work:**

* The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are opened in-game and the rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods.
* Gear Pods are re-usable. They can be opened, closed, recharged, and then re-opened

There are 3 different types of pods:

* **Astral Gear Pod** - most common
* **Cosmic Gear Pod** - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations. All MetaHeroes will be able to use any gear, regardless of their planet of origin.
* **Nebula Gear Pod** - extremely rare

![In total, there are 12 variations of the Gear Pods: 1 Astral, 10 Cosmic and 1 Nebula](<../../../.gitbook/assets/gear pods>)
