# Gear Pods

****[**Gear Pods**](https://metaherouniverse.com/gearpods.html) are "critical supplies" that the [DOTs](DOTs.md) are deploying to [MetaHero Identities](identities.md) to help them power up and explore the [MetaHero Universe](./).

The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are burned in-game and the rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods. There are 3 different types of pods:

* **Astral Gear Pod** - most common
* **Cosmic Gear Pod** - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations. All MetaHeroes will be able to use any gear, regardless of their planet of origin.
* **Nebula Gear Pod** - extremely rare

![In total, there are 12 variations of the Gear Pods: 1 Astral, 10 Cosmic and 1 Nebula](<../../../.gitbook/assets/gear pods>)
