# Species

{% hint style="info" %}
Originally, the additional characters in the MetaHero Universe were called **Sidekicks**. Sidekicks is now a project codename for the additional characters and creatures that'll be released in 2 parts: [DOTs](DOTs.md) & [Species](species.md).
{% endhint %}

Species (tentative name) are characters/creatures in the [MetaHero Universe](./).

**What we know:**

* They're native to each [Planet](planets.md)
* They need to be discovered by the [DOTs](DOTs.md) as part of the MetaHero game

![Sneak peeks of "Sidekicks" which are likely to be closer in style to Species. While these were illustrated by Chris Wahl, the upcoming "Sidekicks" (i.e DOTs and Species) will be created by Blur Studio.](../../../.gitbook/assets/sidekicks\_initialPreview)
