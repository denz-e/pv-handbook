# Pixel Vault Founder's DAO

The **Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO (PVFD)** is collectively owned and governed by owners of PVFD tokens, similar to the [Planets](MHU/planets.md). You can think of the PVFD as a company - only in this company, every team member is a passionate PV fan:

* every member brings their unique skills, knowledge and perspectives to the broader community and DAO
* the company is a close partner to Pixel Vault, as members get exclusive access to GFunk and the team through a private Discord channel
* unlike a traditional company, every member has proportional ownership over the DAO’s growing [vault of assets](https://zapper.fi/account/foundersdao.eth?tab=dashboard), and the power to vote on what the DAO does

**Note for Collectors:**

Pixel Vault is the umbrella company for everything they’ll create over time. That means those in the _**Pixel Vault**_ Founder’s DAO are exposed to everything PV does:

* **directly** - through PV’s decisions to reward PVFD holders with exclusive or priority access to their products
* **indirectly** - through ownership of PV assets in the vault
