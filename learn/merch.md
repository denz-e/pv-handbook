# Merch Store

The [official Pixel Vault merch store](http://shop.pixelvault.com/) is a custom-built solution with web3 integration. It allows individuals to purchase merch using Pixel Vault's native tokens: [$PUNKS](ecosystem/punks/PUNKS.md) and [$POW](ecosystem/MHU/POW.md).

### Merch Drop 1) September 2022

[PUNKS](ecosystem/punks/), [MetaHero Universe](ecosystem/MHU/) and Pixel Vault-branded hats, tees and hoodies were available for purchase at the following prices, for a limited-time window.

* **Hats**: 1,000 $POW / 300 $PUNKS
* **Tees**: 1,000 $POW / 300 $PUNKS
* **Hoodies**: 2,500 $POW / 750 $PUNKS

Notably, all proceeds went back to the Pixel Vault community. $POW was sent to the [UPDAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19c30ad5ea4f7f9f36a8662b5fa2cbc09e55fded), and $PUNKS was sent to the [$PUNKS treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30103ba8d2bd2280144b72401170834e0c608086).
