## Context

One of the core pillars of Pixel Vault is [developing crypto-native IP, and telling their stories.](../learn/overview.md#develop-crypto-native-ip-assets-and-tell-their-stories) After all, that was how Pixel Vault came to be - by telling the stories behind CryptoPunks. It's through stories that we'll get to know more about the [Inhabitants Universe](../learn/ecosystem/IU/). _How did the world come to be? Who are the_ [_Identities_](../learn/ecosystem/IU/identities.md)_? What challenges do they face? What role do the_ [_DOTs_](../learn/ecosystem/IU/DOTs.md) _play? What is life like on the different_ [_planets_](../learn/ecosystem/IU/planets.md)_?_&#x20;

In Aug 2022, Pixel Vault shared that:&#x20;

> _"Another extraordinary comic artist, also of Marvel pedigree, will bring the upcoming MetaHero comics to life. Comics will be available to view online, open to all, and they will introduce characters, lore and stories. You can expect these to be much more than your average comic book"_

**Inhabitants Stories** is exactly that. They're not just static digital comics like [PUNKS Comic](../learn/ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/) or [Origin Stories](../learn/ecosystem/punks/origin-stories.md) â€“ instead, they're animated shorts that are free to view, with an additional digital collectible.
