**Who are the Elite Apes?**

In June 2021, shortly after releasing PUNKS Comic #1, Pixel Vault held a bracket style competition called **Ape Madness:**

* the Bored Ape Yacht Club community submitted names and backstories of their Apes
* Pixel Vault narrowed down the submissions to 64
* PUNKS Comic #1 holders voted on their favourites over 3 rounds, ultimately leaving 8 winners - the **Elite Apes**\
  ****

**All participants of Ape Madness were eligible to claim a commemorative NFT illustrated by Chris Wahl**

Here's the official synopsis:

> _In their constant pursuit of relieving boredom, a small crew of apes travel to Origin City for a night out on the town. Readers of PUNKS #2 will recognize the familiar faces of Hanzo, Lone Star, Kiki, Biz, Tropo, Gold-Rilla, King Blackbored, and BBA as they all try to help a blacked-out Biz retrace his steps from the previous nightâ€™s adventures._ [_(source)_](https://app.punkscomic.com/apes-out-on-the-town)__

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is an Elite Ape Entry Coin?**

Elite Ape Entry Coins are NFTs which Pixel Vault distributed to holders of Pixel Vault and/or Bored Ape Yacht Club assets, for the release of the [Elite Ape Collector's Editions ](../../learn/gamification/punks/comic2.md)of [PUNKS Comic #2](../../learn/ecosystem/punks/punks-comic/#2). It acted as a raffle ticket for the opportunity to mint the Collector's Editions, and to mint, collectors needed to burn their Entry Coin.\


The original 19,328 supply of Entry Coins was reduced to 13,328 after the Elite Ape Collector's Edition mint.
