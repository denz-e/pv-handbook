# Introduction

## What is this?

Hi, I'm [denze](https://twitter.com/\_denze) üëãüèª I created this handbook to help anyone understand & keep up with the Pixel Vault **(PV)** ecosystem. PV is often seen as being _too_ _complex_ and _too overwhelming_ for both new & existing collectors, so my goal is to make things easier.

Think of this as:

1. a quick-reference guide to everything you'd want to know about the PV ecosystem; and
2. a way to keep up with current events & things you need to do

Things change quickly so I'll do my best keeping it up to date, but if I'm missing things, or you have any feedback / ideas, [let me know here](start-here/feedback.md) or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/\_denze)!
